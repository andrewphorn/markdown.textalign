# A Text-Alignment Extension for Markdown

This extension adds the ability to center and right-align text and some content.

## Usage

**Note:** Due to github reportedly not supporting any kind of markdown that does this, I can't show you what happens. You'll just have to take my word for it.

### Center-align

To center-align something, place a dash followed by a right-facing angle bracket, '->', before your text.

Then place a left-facing angle bracket followed by another dash, '<-', to close the center-aligned block.

`-> this is some center-aligned text <-`

### Right-align

To right-align something, place a dash followed by a right-facing angle bracket, '->', before and after your text.

`-> this is some right-aligned text ->`
